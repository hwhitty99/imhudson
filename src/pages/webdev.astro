            It all started in 1999. I was born. That's also when my mom started
            telling me that I should become and engineer. And rightly so. I
            liked solving problems, building things, taking things apart, fixing
            things, I was good at math...you get the picture. She had the best
            intentions and wanted to encourage me to pursue what I was good at
            and liked doing.

            I didn't write a single line of code in highschool. So, when it came
            to picking a major, the only reason I even considered a CS degree
            was because I was technologically inclined and my favorite class up
            to that point had been my highschool's "technology" class, which was
            essentially Photoshop and Excel for beginners. Material UI was all
            the rage in 2016, so once I learned the basics of PS,
            <a
                href={forFun.src}
                class="font-semibold text-red-500 hover:underline"
                >I designed this UI</a
            ><i> for fun</i>. I had rooted (and bricked and then revived)
            multiple Androids at that point and would spend ridiculous amounts
            of time designing my personal mobile software experience through
            launchers, icon packs, and custom ROMs.
            <b>
                I was a UI/UX designer at age 17, but because I didn't know that
                was a thing, I was still convinced I was going to be an
                engineer.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            So did I pick a CS degree or an engineering degree? Yes. Software
            Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software Engineering at ONU, as a major, split ENGR and CSIS courses
            50/50 and existed for maybe 6 years. Me and my 6 other software
            engineering majors were the last to graduate from ONU. I don't know
            what that says about the major but if it says anything it's probably
            not positive. The engineering half of my college education was
            arguably useless and the computer science half prepared me to work
            on microcontrollers and write Java...which did not excite me.
        </p>
        <p>
            What did excite me? For my year-long sophomore Java course we had to
            replicate the class Simon game with <a
                href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7p2whiua/production/fbc71c08c5e80094d71e416b14ee3085ed390345-2048x1536.jpg?w=900&auto=format"
                class="text-red-500 hover:underline">NXT robots</a
            >. I completed the project in record time. Then I spent about twice
            as long designing the monochromatic pixel art that displayed the
            player's level, their high score, and the navigation menu. That was
            not required work I just got really passionate about it for some
            reason. In my Android app development course, I discovered <a
                href="https://medium.com/google-design/designing-adaptive-icons-515af294c783"
                target="_blank">adaptive icons</a
            >. Fun fact, on Andoird O and later, every app icon can be multiple
            layers and they react to your scolling in an elastic-like animation,
            which is so cool and satisfying. Don't believe me? Go try it. It's
            fun. I enjoyed creating those silly little icons more than actually
            programming the apps. Again, we weren't required to create adaptive
            icons for our apps and our prof never taught us about them; I was
            just passionate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, senior year rolled around. I needed some filler classes to
            be considered a full time student and be allowed to live on campus.
            I added a art/programming course to my schedule for my last semester
            of college. We developed a 2D scroller game, and 3D kart racing game
            in Unity, an app prototype in Adobe XD, and two websites: one to
            sell something that we could offer and one to display all our
            projects from the course. I was hooked! The game development didn't
            really speak to me, but I was incredibly excited about app
            prototyping and web development because they clicked. I understood
            the course material with ease and my projects were miles ahead of my
            classmates'. Granted, that wasn't a very high bar, but I'm still
            proud of what I created and it meant a lot to me at the time. I was
            the guy helping my classmates instead of the guy asking his
            classmates for help (which was usually the case).
        </p>
        <p>
            The year prior to this class, I went home for spring break and never
            came back, due to COVID. During that whole "stay at home or you'll
            die and if you don't die you'll kill someone else" summer of 2020, I
            started an online clothing store through Shopify. I only mention
            this because it was a huge part in discovering my passion for web
            development/design. I loved designing each page of the website, even
            though it was tedious. I grew passionate about content layout,
            interaction animations, and user experience through this project. At
            this point, I still hadn't really written in any web development
            languages because I could do most of what I wanted through Shopify
            or their plugins. But, this was my first taste of HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript because every once in a while they were required to get
            my vision for a page pixel perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest really is history. Senior year I went deep down the web dev
            and UI design YouTube rabbit holes and, shortly after graduating,
            somehow got the job I'm at now where I'm still constantly learning
            and feel totally incompetnant next to my much more experienced
            coworkers.

            At this point I'm your average web developer who's obsessed with
            every new framework and plugin he sees but won't actually spend the
            time to learn/use them and I'm your average UI/UX designer who has a
            brilliant eye for design but feels like literally everyone else in
            the industry is better than me.
