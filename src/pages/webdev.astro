      It all started in 1999. I was born. That's also when my mom started
      telling me that I should become and engineer. And rightly so. I liked
      solving problems, building things, taking things apart, fixing things, I
      was good at math...you get the picture. She had the best intentions and
      wanted to encourage me to pursue what I was good at and liked doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't write a single line of code in highschool. So, when it came to
      picking a major, the only reason I even considered a CS degree was because
      I was technologically inclined and my favorite class up to that point had
      been my highschool's "technology" class (which was essentially Photoshop
      and Excel for beginners). I had rooted (and bricked and then revived)
      multiple Androids at that point and would spend ridiculous amounts of time
      designing my personal mobile software experience through launchers, icon
      packs, and custom ROMs. I was a UI/UX designer before I knew what that
      meant, but still thought I was for sure going to be an engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did I pick a CS degree or an engineering degree? Yes. Software
      Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software Engineering at ONU, as a major, split ENGR and CSIS courses 50/50
      and existed for maybe 6 years. Me and my 6 other software engineering
      majors were the last to graduate from ONU. I don't know what that says
      about the major but if it says anything it's probably not positive. The
      engineering half of my college education was arguably useless and the
      computer science half prepared me to work on microcontrollers and write
      java...which did not excite me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did excite me? For my year-long sophomore java course we programmed
      NXT robots to replicate the Simon game. I completed the project in record
      time. Then I spent about twice as long designing the monochromatic pixel
      art that displayed the player's level, their high score, and the
      navigation menu. That was not required work I just got really passionate
      about it for some reason. In my Android app development course, I
      discovered dynamic icons. Fun fact, on Andoird, every app icon can be
      multiple layers and they react to your scolling in a "rubber band" like
      way, which is so cool and satisfying. Don't believe me? Go try it. It's
      fun. I enjoyed creating those silly little icons more than actually
      programming the apps. Again, we weren't required to create dynamic icons
      for our apps and our prof never taught us about them; I was just
      passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, senior year rolled around and I could almost graduate a semester
      early, so I needed some filler classes to be considered a full time
      student and live on campus. I added a art/programming course to my
      schedule for my last semester of college and . We developed a 2D scroller
      game, and 3D kart racing game in Unity, an app prototype in Adobe XD, and
      two websites: one to sell something that we could offer and one to display
      all our projects from the course. I was hooked! The game development
      didn't really speak to me, but I was incredibly excited about app
      prototyping and web development because they clicked for me. I understood
      the course material with ease and my projects were miles ahead of my
      classmates'. That wasn't a very high bar, granted, but I'm still proud of
      what I created. I was the guy helping my friend instead of the guy asking
      his friend for help (which was usually me in most classes).
    </p>
    <p>
      The year prior to this class, I went home for spring break and never came
      back, due to COVID. During that whole "stay at home or you'll die and if
      you don't die you'll kill someone else" summer of 2020, I started an
      online clothing store through Shopify. I only mention this because it was
      a huge part in discovering my passion for web development/design. I loved
      designing each page of the website, even though it was tedious. I grew
      passionate about content layout, interaction animations, and user
      experience through this project. At this point, I still hadn't really
      written in any web development languages because I could do most of what I
      wanted through Shopify or their plugins. But, this was my first taste of
      HTML, CSS, and javascript because every once in a while they were required
      to get my vision for a page pixel perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest really is history. Senior year I went deep down the web dev and
      UI design YouTube rabbit holes and, shortly after graduating, somehow got
      the job I'm at now where I'm still constantly learning and feel totally
      incompetnant next to my much more experienced coworkers.

      At this point I'm your average web developer who's obsessed with every new
      framework and plugin he sees but won't actually spend the time to
      learn/use them and I'm your average UI/UX designer who has a brilliant eye
      for design but feels like literally everyone else in the industry is
      better than me.

      When I see a massive html file I get excited and want to figure out how
      the entire structure works. I've wasted time redesigning craiglist in the
      devTools. I watched the entire talk at Tailwind Connect on YouTube. I made
      my own VSCode theme. Half the reason I use Arc Browser is for the icon
      animations. I've spent time and money on two UI design courses taught by a
      YouTuber who owns a design agency. A decent percentage of my brain's
      storage is filled with keyboard shortcuts. I have a folder of bookmarks
      titled "things I want to use one day" that includes Pinia, Oruga, and
      Penpot. Just yesterday I was geeking out about this <a

      Now you understand why a senior developer I work with and respect once
      messaged me, "You have problems."
