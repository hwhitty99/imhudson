                    I have a software engineering degree. And yet, I've been
                    conning
                    <a href="https://mir.us" target="_blank"> Mirus Research</a>
                     into thinking I'm a web developer for the past two years.
                    ðŸ¤« How did I get here? Well, this is how.

                <p>
                    This interest has only developed (get it?) recently. In May
                    2022 I went to Iceland for a week and my friend let me shoot
                    some color positive film in his Cannon A-1. I shortly got my
                    own Nikon FE and have been shooting everywhere I go since.

                    There are a lot of people, software, and resources that I
                    have found over the years that I don't hate. I've decided to
                    curate and organize them here. Definitely check this list
                    out because there's nothing there for you.
