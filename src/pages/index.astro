                    I have a degree in software engineering from Olivet Nazarene
                    University. To earn that piece of paper I wrote a lot of
                    Java, a little bit of C++, and spent way too much time
                    writing papers about thermofluids that never got graded (I'm
                    still salty,

                        target="_blank">Schroeder</a
                    >). Those were all boring so, instead of trying my senior
                    year, I did graphic design and web development on the side.
                    Somehow, shortly after graduating, I got a job at
                    <a href="https://mir.us" target="_blank">Mirus Research</a>
                     and I've been conning them for the past two years. ðŸ¤«

                    This interest has only developed (get it?) recently. In May
                    2022 I went to Iceland for a week and my friend let my shoot
                    a roll in his Cannon A-1. Obviously I was hooked. I got my
                    own Nikon FE and have been shooting everywhere I go since.

                    There are a lot of people, software, and resources that I
                    have found over the years that I don't hate. I've decided to
                    curate and organize them here. Definitely check this list
                    out because there's nothing there for you.
