> My personal website. Originally created so I could say &#34;yes&#34; when asked &#34;have you ever made a website from scratch?&#34; or &#34;could you make me a website?&#34;. Learned about hosting and creating a workflow for production and development and now have a place where I can add anything I want, whenever I want, and make it look however I want. Pretty fun.
