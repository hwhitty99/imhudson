It all started in 1999. I was born. That's also when my mom started
            telling me that I should become and engineer. And rightly so. I
            liked solving problems, building things, taking things apart, fixing
            things, I was good at math...you get the picture. She had the best
            intentions and encouraged me to pursue what I was good at and what I
            liked doing.
</p> <p>
I didn't write a single line of code in highschool. So, when it came
            to picking a major, the only reason I even considered a CS degree
            was because I was technologically inclined and becuase my favorite
            class up to that point had been, what my highschool called,
            "Technology", which was essentially Photoshop and Excel for
            beginners.
</p> <p>
I caught on to PS pretty quickly, so once I learned the basics, I
            designed
<a href="/_astro/FOR FUN.BvnG-YdR.jpg" target="_blank">this very Material-Design-looking UI</a><i> for fun</i>. That's a mockup of a to-do app homepage that I
            designed in Photoshop and literally exported as <code>FOR FUN.jpeg</code>. When I wasn't learning <a href="https://youtu.be/QTjeV_2z_LY?si=owkT-8_Q3eub1BOH" target="_blank">magic tricks</a>, that's apparently what I was doing for fun in 2016.
</p> <p>
I had rooted (and bricked and then revived) multiple Androids at
            this point and spent ridiculous amounts of time designing my mobile
            software experience through launchers, icon packs, and custom ROMs.
<b> I was a UI/UX designer at age 17</b>, but I didn't know that was
            a thing, so I was still convinced I was going to be an engineer.
</p> <p>
So did I pick a CS degree or an engineering degree? Yes. Software
            Engineering.
</p> <p>
Software Engineering at ONU, as a major, split ENGR and CSIS courses
            50/50 and existed for maybe 6 years. Myself and the 6 other software
            engineering majors of 2021 were the last to graduate from ONU. The
            engineering half of my college education has become arguably useless
            and the computer science half prepared me to work on
            microcontrollers and write Java...which did not excite me.
</p> <p>
What did excite me? As a project for my year-long sophomore Java
            course, we had to replicate the classic Simon game using <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7p2whiua/production/fbc71c08c5e80094d71e416b14ee3085ed390345-2048x1536.jpg?w=900&auto=format" target="_blank">NXT robots</a>. I completed the project in record time. Then I spent about twice
            as long designing the monochromatic pixel art that displayed the
            player's level, the high score, and the navigation menu. That was
            not required work; I just got really passionate about it for some
            reason. In my Android development course, I discovered <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/designing-adaptive-icons-515af294c783" target="_blank">adaptive icons</a>. Fun fact, on Andoird O and later, every app icon can be multiple
            layers and they can react to your scolling in an elastic-like
            animation, which is so cool and satisfying. I enjoyed designing
            those silly little icons more than actually programming the apps.
            Again, we weren't required to create adaptive icons for our apps and
            our prof never taught us about them; I was just passionate.
</p> <p>
Finally, senior year rolled around. I needed some filler classes to
            be considered a full time student and be allowed to live on campus.
            I added an art/programming course to my last semester of college. We
            developed a 2D scroller game, and 3D kart racing game in Unity, an
            app prototype in Adobe XD, and two websites: one to sell something
            that we could offer as an individual and one to display all our
            projects from the course. I was hooked! The game development
            projects didn't really speak to me, but I was incredibly excited
            about app prototyping and web development because they clicked. I
            understood the course material with ease and my projects were miles
            ahead of my classmates'. Surprisingly, I was the guy helping my
            classmates instead of the guy asking his classmates for help (which
            was usually the case).
</p> <p>
The year prior to this class, I went home for spring break and never
            came back, due to COVID. During that whole "stay at home or you'll
            die and if you don't die you'll kill someone else" summer of 2020, I
            started an online clothing store through Shopify. I only mention
            this because it was a huge part in discovering my passion for web
            development/design. I loved designing each page of the website, even
            though it was tedious. I grew passionate about content layout,
            interaction animations, and user experience through this project. At
            this point, I still hadn't really written in any web development
            languages because I could do most of what I wanted through Shopify
            or their plugins. But, this was my first taste of HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript because every once in a while they were required to get
            my vision for a page pixel perfect.
</p> <p>
The rest really is history. Senior year I went deep down the web dev
            and UI design YouTube rabbit holes and, shortly after graduating,
            somehow got the job I'm at now where I'm still constantly learning
            and feel totally incompetnant next to my much more experienced
            coworkers.

At this point I'm your average frontend web developer. I've found my
            place.
</p> <p>
When I see a massive html file I get excited and want to figure out
            how the entire structure works. I've wasted time redesigning
            craiglist in the devTools. I watched the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLkxRnRQtDE" target="_blank">Tailwind Connect talk</a> on YouTube. I'm obsessed with every new framework and node module I
            learn about. I made my own <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HudsonWhittaker.hudson-green-dark" target="_blank">VSCode theme</a>. Half the reason I use <a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank">Arc Browser</a> is for the icon animations. I've spent time and money on two UI design
            courses taught by a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MalewiczHype" target="_blank">YouTuber</a> who owns a <a href="https://www.squareblack.com/" target="_blank">design agency</a>. A decent percentage of my brain's storage is filled with keyboard
            shortcuts. I look back at code I only wrote a year ago and cringe. I
            have a folder of bookmarks titled "things I want to use one day"
            that includes <a href="https://pinia.vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Pinia</a>, <a href="https://oruga.io/" target="_blank">Oruga</a>, and
<a href="https://penpot.app/" target="_blank">Penpot</a>. Just
            yesterday I was geeking out about this <a href="https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23fff,%20white%0D%0A%23000,%20black%0D%0A%23fff8ed,%20orange-50%0D%0A%23feefd6,%20orange-100%0D%0A%23fcdbac,%20orange-200%0D%0A%23fac177,%20orange-300%0D%0A%23f79b40,%20orange-400%0D%0A%23f58220,%20orange-500%0D%0A%23e66410,%20orange-600%0D%0A%23bf4b0f,%20orange-700%0D%0A%23973c15,%20orange-800%0D%0A%237a3314,%20orange-900%0D%0A%23421808,%20orange-950%0D%0A%23f9fafb,%20gray-50%0D%0A%23f3f4f6,%20gray-100%0D%0A%23e5e7eb,%20gray-200%0D%0A%23d1d5db,%20gray-300%0D%0A%239ca3af,%20gray-400%0D%0A%236b7280,%20gray-500%0D%0A%234b5563,%20gray-600%0D%0A%23374151,%20gray-700%0D%0A%231f2937,%20gray-800%0D%0A%23111827,%20gray-900%0D%0A%23FFFFFF,%20red-50%0D%0A%23f9edee,%20red-100%0D%0A%23FBB1B9,%20red-200%0D%0A%23F98691,%20red-300%0D%0A%23F75565,%20red-400%0D%0A%23F20C23,%20red-500%0D%0A%23D62311,%20red-600%0D%0A%23a11b13,%20red-700%0D%0A%23920715,%20red-800%0D%0A%2357040D,%20red-900%0D%0A%23eff6ff,%20blue-50%0D%0A%23dbeafe,%20blue-100%0D%0A%23bfdbfe,%20blue-200%0D%0A%2393c5fd,%20blue-300%0D%0A%2360a5fa,%20blue-400%0D%0A%233b82f6,%20blue-500%0D%0A%232563eb,%20blue-600%0D%0A%231d4ed8,%20blue-700%0D%0A%231e40af,%20blue-800%0D%0A%231e3a8a,%20blue-900&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18" target="_blank">color contrast chart website</a> and want to make a poster out of it.
</p> <p>
These are just a few reasons why a senior backend dev I work with
            and respect once told me, "You have problems."
</p> <p>
I love the internet. And I want to improve as a web developer every
            day, so that I can make it a more beautiful, useful, and encouraging
            place.
